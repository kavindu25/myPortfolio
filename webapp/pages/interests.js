                    <p>Apart from being an undergraduate, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. During my free time, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking.</p>
                    <p class="mb-0">When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef, and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technology advancements in the front-end web development world.</p>
